# toontown-corp-clash-client
This is a Python Botting/Hacked Client for Toontown Corporate Clash 1.4.5.

This project uses `win32api` ReadProcessMemory to fetch a Player's location and health, and then uses PyAutoGui to move the Player. Future releases will likely attempt to write to memory directly (allowing the bot to run in the background).
